# Lynk

**Lynk** is a cross-platform file transfer application built with Flutter that enables direct peer-to-peer file sharing over a local network using raw socket connections. Users can send and receive files between devices by switching between **Server** and **Client** tabs within the app.

- The **Server tab** opens a socket and listens for incoming connections. When a client connects and sends a file, the server allows for saving the files to a desired directory.
- The **Client tab** allows the user to input the server's IP address, select a file, and send it directly.

Lynk is ideal for quick, local file transfers without relying on cloud services, internet access, or third-party tools.

### ⚠️ Notes
- Files are saved locally on the server device in a user defined directory.
- The app is designed for trusted local networks only — it does not include built-in encryption or authentication.
- For secure transfers on untrusted networks, use Lynk in conjunction with a VPN or encrypted tunnel.
- Web is not supported due to limitations in Flutter's socket support for browsers.
